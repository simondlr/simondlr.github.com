- Creator of <a href="http://tweekly.fm">Tweekly.fm</a>. One of the first 500 Twitter applications. It allowed users to automatically share their music tastes from last.fm to Twitter. Now, a few years on, with the help of <a href="http://twitter.com/ssx">Scott Wilcox</a>, it shares to 450 000+ updates a month from 270k users to Twitter and Facebook. It has sent more than 15 million updates. A lot of sites depend on Tweekly.fm's updates to Twitter to get an accurate measure of what people are listening to on social media sites.<br />
